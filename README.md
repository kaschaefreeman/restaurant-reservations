## Client Documentation

The reservations system allows restaurants to track and input reservations as well as track and input tables.  Reservations may be seated at tables and the user can view which tables are open or occupied.

### Dashboard

![dashboard](front-end/demo-screenshots/dashboard.PNG)

The dashboard will be the home page and is split into two components: Reservations and Tables

#### Reservations on Dashboard

The reservations component on the dashboard displays the reservations for a selected date in table format.  By default, the date will be set to the current date.  The date may be changed by 3 date change buttons prev, today, and next.  Clicking this date will re-query the GET request sent to the API to reload the tables.

The reservations listed on the dashboard will be filtered by those that are with status of "booked" or "seated" only.

The final column of the reservations table will be an "actions" drop-down button and a cancel button for each reservation.  The actions available will be "seat" or "edit"

The seat button will redirect to the Seating Reservation Page where the reservation can be seated at a table when ready. (see below for more info). This button will only display if the reservation is not already seated

The edit button will redirect to the Edit Reservation Form.  This will be the same as the New Reservation form except the selected reservations information will be loaded onto the form and the reservation and a PUT request will be sent to the API instead of POST to update th reservation.

![edit reservation](front-end/demo-screenshots/edit.PNG)

The cancel button will set the reservations status as "cancelled".

On click the window will ask to confirm the user wants to cancel the reservation.

On confirm, the reservation's status will be changed and the reservations reloaded for the selected date filtering out the reservations that are cancelled.  No action will be taken on cancel of the confirmation

![cancel reservation](front-end/demo-screenshots/cancel-reservation.PNG)

#### Tables on Dashboard

The tables component on the dashboard will display all tables and display if the table is occupied or free.

Next to each occupied table will be a "finish" button that will ask to confirm if the user wants to mark the reservation as finished and free the table for the next reservation.  This action can not be undone.

On Confirm the Dashboard will be reloaded with the table free and the reservation at that table will be marked finished removing it from the reservations list on the dashboard. No actions will be taken on cancel.

![finish table](front-end/demo-screenshots/finish-table.PNG)

### Seating a Reservation

![seating reservation](front-end/demo-screenshots/seating.PNG)

Seating a reservation will assign the reservation to the table and mark the reservation's status as "seated"

On the page a form with a select options input will be displayed.

The user will need to select the table to seat the reservation at.

The options will be displayed as "table name - table capacity".

the reservations capacity must be kept in mind so that the user does not select a table that is too small for the reservation.  This will display an error on the page if so and no action taken.

On a successful submission,  The user will be taken back to the dashboard and the table will be updated with status occupied and the reservation will be updated with status "seated"

### Searching for Reservation

![search for reservation](front-end/demo-screenshots/search.PNG)

Reservations can be searched by mobile number using the search link on the navigation bar.

An input box to enter the mobile number will be displayed and on submit the same reservations listed on the dashboard will be loaded below.  However, these reservations will not be filtered by their status, so all finished and cancelled reservations will also display on this list.

The reservations will have the same action and cancel buttons.  However, the edit option from the drop-down of actions will be displayed for reservations that are cancelled.  This will also take the user to the Edit Reservation Form, but the option to change the reservation from cancelled to booked will be available in the case that they may have cancelled in error or customer changed their mind.

### New Reservation Form

![new reservation form](front-end/demo-screenshots/new-reservation.PNG)

A new reservation can be created by clicking the new reservation link on the navigation bar.

This will display a form to enter the reservation info including: First Name, Last Name, Mobile Number, Reservation Time, Reservation Date, and the number of people needing to be seated (which is defaulted to 1).

All fields will be required and any restrictions violated from the backend will be displayed at the top of the form.

On submit, the user will be taken back to the dashboard displaying reservation for the date of the newly created reservation so that it can be visible on the reservations table.

If the form is cancelled the user will be pushed back to their last visited page.

### New Table Form

![new tables form](front-end/demo-screenshots/new-tables.PNG)

New tables can be added by using the New Table link on the navigation.

A form will be display with inputs for the table name and capacity

All fields will be required and any restrictions violated on the backend will be displayed at the top of the form.  

User will need to be sure to enter the correct information as there is not yet a feature to edit or delete tables once created

On submit of the form, the user will be taken to the dashboard page with the current date's reservations loaded, and the new table will be visible on the tables section of the dashboard.  

On cancel, the user will be directed back to their previous location.
